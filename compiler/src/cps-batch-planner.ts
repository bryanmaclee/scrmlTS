/**
 * CPS Multi-Batch Planner — Ext 1 M1.3 (multi-batch CPS).
 *
 * The substantive Ext 1 algorithm. Given a statement-grain body-DG (from M1.2's
 * `buildBodyDG`) with tier-classified nodes, produce a MULTI-BATCH PLAN: a list
 * of server batches, each a contiguous run of server statements that commit as
 * one transactional envelope, separated by client work that must observe an
 * earlier batch's commit before a later batch can start.
 *
 * The A9 min-viable body-split (Ext 4 + Ext 5, S72) split a body into exactly
 * ONE server batch. Ext 1 extends to N batches — a body crosses the seam
 * multiple times. This planner is the per-function-body decision procedure.
 *
 * ── Algorithm (scope-dive §B.3 / predecessor §3.1) ─────────────────────────
 *   1. Topologically sort the DG, preferring orderings that keep contiguous
 *      server runs together (server-biased Kahn list-scheduling).
 *   2. Coalesce contiguous server runs into batches: server statements i, j
 *      (i before j in topo order) join the SAME batch iff no client-tier
 *      statement sits between them in topo order. A client statement forces a
 *      wait for batch i to commit before batch j may start — a batch boundary.
 *   3. Detect irreducible cross-batch durable WRITE dependencies — the
 *      write → client-read → write pattern across two batches.
 *   4. Detect `<machine>` `.advance()` transitions that cross batch boundaries.
 *   5. If any irreducible dep / machine crossing → reject with the relevant
 *      diagnostic. Otherwise → return the batch list.
 *
 * ── Soundness (body-split soundness DD §3.4 — S3 is load-bearing) ──────────
 *   S3 monotonicity-preserving-ordering is CLEAN under the reorder verdict IF
 *   AND ONLY IF the DG edges are conservative AND the scheduler respects every
 *   edge. The body-DG (M1.2) is conservative-over-approximate by construction.
 *   This planner's topo sort respects ALL FIVE edge kinds — `reads`, `writes`,
 *   `awaits`, `invalidates`, `control-anchors` — as hard "must-not-precede"
 *   constraints; it NEVER reorders across any of them. Any topological sort of
 *   a data-dependency DAG produces the same observable result at every
 *   observable cut point (Lam/Wegman list-scheduling). The scheduler here only
 *   uses tie-break preference (server-bias) to CHOOSE AMONG already-legal
 *   orderings — it never violates a constraint to satisfy the preference.
 *
 *   `control-anchors` edges are honoured identically to data edges: the
 *   scheduler treats them as ordering constraints and the coalescer can never
 *   merge a server run across a control-flow statement, because the anchor
 *   edges fence the control-flow node to its source-order neighbours.
 *
 * ── Reject paths ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   E-CPS-MULTIBATCH-REORDER         — an irreducible cross-batch durable-write
 *                                      dependency (SQL-row identity needing
 *                                      transactional consistency read again in
 *                                      a later batch). §34 registration lands
 *                                      at M1.6; this module produces the
 *                                      diagnostic SHAPE + offending edge.
 *   E-CPS-MULTIBATCH-MACHINE-CROSSING — a `<machine>` `.advance()` chain where
 *                                      two advances on the same machine land
 *                                      in different batches. §34 registration
 *                                      lands at M1.6.
 *
 * ── Admissible cross-batch forwarding ──────────────────────────────────────
 *   A `@reactive` cell written in batch B and read again in batch B' is NOT a
 *   reject — the value is marshalled forward as a parameter to the second stub
 *   (M1.5 emit). Only SQL-row-identity cross-batch deps (the `invalidates` /
 *   SQL-mediated `writes` edge family) are irreducible.

 * Kahn's-algorithm topological sort over the body-DG.
 *
 * Edge direction (M1.2 convention): `edge.from` DEPENDS ON `edge.to` —
 * `from` must run AFTER `to`. So `to` must be scheduled BEFORE `from`: the
 * edge contributes one unit of in-degree to `from`, and a successor `from` to
 * `to`'s adjacency list.
 *
 * SOUNDNESS: every edge is an absolute ordering constraint. The tie-break
 * (below) only ever selects among nodes that are ALL currently ready
 * (in-degree 0) — it never violates a constraint. Any topological sort of a
 * data-dependency DAG is observationally equivalent (S3 reorder verdict).
 *
 * Tie-break, when multiple nodes are ready: prefer the LOWEST source index.
 *
 * Why source-order and NOT a server-bias hoist: a server-bias that hoisted an
 * independent later server past an intervening client statement would COLLAPSE
 * two batches into one — defeating the multi-batch shape the brief's two-batch
 * and three-batch fixtures require (server / client / server MUST be two
 * batches). A client statement that sits between two server statements in
 * SOURCE ORDER represents observable client work between two server round
 * trips; the planner must NOT reorder it away. Source-order tie-break keeps
 * the schedule faithful to the source and lets the coalescer (Step 2) see the
 * genuine batch boundaries. The conservative body-DG already guarantees source
 * order is a legal topological order; the tie-break only deviates from source
 * order when a DG edge forces a later statement to run earlier — which never
 * happens for a straight-line list whose edges all run `from > to`. "Preferring
 * contiguous server runs" (scope-dive §B.3) is satisfied trivially: source
 * order already keeps every contiguous source-order server run contiguous.

 * edges (SQL non-SELECT → SQL SELECT, same table). When such an edge connects
 * a statement in batch B' back to a statement in an EARLIER batch B
 * (B' > B), the two server batches both touch the same durable resource and a
 * client statement sits between them.
 *
 * TWO SUB-CASES (scope-dive §B.3 / predecessor §3.1 step 5):
 *   - `writes` edge on a `@reactive` cell → ADMISSIBLE. The cell's value is
 *     marshalled forward as a parameter to the later stub (M1.5 emit). A
 *     reactive cell is a single in-memory value, not a transactional row —
 *     forwarding it preserves the observable result.
 *   - `invalidates` edge (SQL-row identity) → IRREDUCIBLE. The later batch's
 *     SELECT needs transactional consistency with the earlier batch's write;
 *     splitting them across two server requests breaks that consistency
 *     envelope. REJECT with E-CPS-MULTIBATCH-REORDER.
 *
 * `awaits` edges are NOT reject candidates — they are exactly the chained-CPS
 * pattern multi-batch CPS is designed to support (the later batch awaits the
 * earlier batch's result; M1.5 forwards it as a parameter). `reads` edges on
 * non-reactive locals likewise forward as parameters. `control-anchors` edges
