**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-117.md` (S114 CLOSE — rotated at S115 OPEN)
**Machine:** single-machine (S100 directive holds)
**HEAD at S115 OPEN:** `092fa90a` (S114 wrap — native-parser front-end COMPLETE + v0.4.0 + Approach C)
**Origin sync at OPEN:** scrmlTS 0/0 · scrml-support 0/0 — both clean, in sync.

## S115 OPEN — caught-up state

Session-start checklist complete: pa.md (full) · PRIMER (full) · SPEC-INDEX (full) · master-list §0 (full) · hand-off S114 CLOSE · user-voice S110/S111/S114 (5 S114 ratifications). Both repos fetched, 0/0. No incoming messages. Worktrees: main only. Hook config B (pre-commit + post-commit + pre-push).

## S115 — DD #27 RESOLVED + RATIFIED (compressed MD ladder)

**OPEN finding (resolved):** at S115 OPEN the #27 DD output file did not exist — background agents are session-scoped and the S114 wrap closed the session before it persisted. User completed the DD out-of-session (scrml-support `bc35fbc`); PA pulled + read in full.

**DD #27 verdict — COMPRESSED MD LADDER.** Per-feature retire-vs-bridge classification, grep-grounded. Revised M5+M6 ≈ 58-91h / 70-110h-with-risk vs the M5 agent's ~98-146h / 150-180h baseline (~35-40% compression).

**All four pivots RATIFIED S115 (via AskUserQuestion, all as DD-recommended):**
- **Pivot 1 — Retire F2 (ESTree decorations).** ~22-32h savings. ~3 kind-test rewrites (emit-expr.ts / emit-logic.ts / emit-table-for.ts) + `EscapeHatchExpr.estreeType` → `nativeKind` rename.
- **Pivot 2 — Move F5 PGO has* flags downstream, option (a).** `computePGOFlags` pre-codegen pass; perf preserved.
- **Pivot 3 — Shape α.** v0.5 = retire-class + cheap bridge-lights (F2/F3/F4/F5/F6/F9 ≈ 19-36h); v0.6 = F1 attrs + F7 + F8 + M5 swap + M6 delete (≈ 49-80h).
- **F7 ceiling — accept 20-30h, NOT deferred.**

EscapeHatchExpr KEPT (field renamed). Per-feature table + full verdict in `scrml-support/docs/deep-dives/m5-m6-scope-revision-2026-05-21.md`.

**v0.5 cut IN FLIGHT (S115).** Maps refreshed (`092fa90a`, all 10). SCOPE + 3 briefs committed `ea97993e`. Three parallel dispatches fired (`scrml-js-codegen-engineer`, isolation:worktree, base `ea97993e`):

| Dispatch | Unit | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A | U1/F2 — estreeType→nativeKind | ✅ LANDED `65157654` |
| B | U3+U4/F5+F6 — downstream pre-codegen passes | ✅ LANDED `85645a93` |
| C | U2/F3 — native-parser collectHoisted | ✅ LANDED `3c21c885` |

**v0.5 first cut COMPLETE — all 3 dispatches landed S115.** Composition verified: A+B+C full suite **17900 pass / 0 fail / 169 skip / 1 todo / 733 files** (run in the A worktree post-merge before landing A). F4 (SpanTable) + F9 (switch scanner) carry no v0.5 work — retirements realized at M6.

- **C** — `collect-hoisted.{scrml,js}` (native-parser) + 54 conformance tests.
- **B** — `compute-pgo-flags.ts` + `compute-program-config.ts` (new), `api.js` PRECG stage, `ast-builder.js` −228 LOC.
- **A** — `estreeType→nativeKind` rename (10 src + 7 test) + dual-mode codegen kind-tests. A's branch merged with main (B+C) before landing — `ast-builder.js` cross-edit auto-resolved (disjoint regions).

**Process notes (S115):** (1) CWD-slip recurred during C's file-delta — caught, recovered, no damage. (2) A's agent used `--no-verify` on 7 intermediate WIP commits (brief violation) — zero effect on main (landed via file-delta + PA commit through the full gate; agent branch discarded). (3) DD #27 understated F2 (10 files not 3) — caught at PA pre-dispatch verification, SCOPE corrected.

**Worktrees A/B/C retained until wrap** (S67 bounded retention) — clean at wrap. **Push pending** — main 4 ahead of origin (`ea97993e` scope-lock + 3 landings), authorized no-push.

**Next:** v0.6 = F1 attrs + F7 state/sql/css + F8 + M5 swap + M6 deletion. Ext 1 (dispatch-ready, user-flagged "asap" S114) is the other queued thread.

**⚠️ CWD-slip recurred (S115)** — `git checkout <branch> -- <files>` file-delta hit the S94 slip (CWD → worktree, empty staged-delta). Caught via pwd-check, recovered with explicit `cd` to main. No damage. **`cd /home/bryan-maclee/scrmlMaster/scrmlTS &&` prefix every remaining file-delta op + pwd-verify after.**

**After v0.5 lands:** Ext 1 (dispatch-ready brief, user-flagged "asap" S114) is the next queued thread. v0.6 = F1 attrs + F7 state/sql/css + F8 + M5 swap + M6 deletion.

## Maps currency

`.claude/maps/` watermark `e613621` — HEAD `092fa90a` is **19 commits ahead**. Maps are stale. Refresh required before any compiler-source dev dispatch (M5-FULL / Ext 1). NOT blocking for the #27 DD re-dispatch (research agent).

## Carry-forward queue (from S114 CLOSE — verbatim, see hand-off-117.md for full detail)

1. **#27 M5/M6 scope-revision DD** — ✅ RESOLVED + all 4 pivots RATIFIED S115 (see section above). Compressed MD ladder is the M5-FULL/M6 path; v0.5 = retire-class cheap-wins, v0.6 = swap+delete.
2. **Grain debate (S112 PARKED)** — whole-stage vs nanopass. M5-LIGHT close IS the revisit moment. Queued.
3. **Ext 1+3+2 — ready to dispatch.** Ext 1 brief authored (`docs/changes/full-body-split/EXT-1-IMPL-BRIEF.md`, 293L, dispatch-ready). Ext 3 + Ext 2 briefs NOT yet authored. M1.1 (type lift, 3-4h) is the first sub-step.
4. **Open questions from S114 DDs** (5 ^{}-expressiveness + 5 import:host-grammar + 1 Ext-scope) — see hand-off-117.md §"Open questions / carry-forwards".
5. **Pre-existing carry-forwards:** §29 vanilla-interop disposition (S110 — open, user has not ruled); generator (`yield`/`function*`) policy (S114 separate conversation); tableFor v1.next impl (~10-15h); K-ledger CLOSED 12-of-12 (next is K13); the MK4 lazy-require ESM cycle (future K-class extraction if judged unclean).
