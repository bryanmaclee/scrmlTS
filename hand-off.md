# scrmlTS — Session 86 (CLOSE — LANDMARK session; largest by every dimension)

**Date:** 2026-05-12 (S86; one full day's work)
**Previous:** `handOffs/hand-off-85.md` (S85 close)
**This file:** rotates to `handOffs/hand-off-86.md` at S87 open

**Tests at S86 CLOSE:** **11,593 pass / 114 skip / 1 todo / 0 fail / 563 files** at HEAD `95bd7f9` (full suite via `bun run test`). Cumulative S85→S86 delta: **+86 pass / +14 skip / +6 files / 0 regressions**.

**S86 commits: 15 PA-authored.** Largest session by commit count + scope + ratification breadth. v0.3 landmark session — Wave 2 implementation + Approach A spec anchor + 4 user-ratifications + WebKit unblocked + 4 latent compiler bugs surfaced for triage.

**Semver state:** unchanged — v0.2.6 `efbd1e8` is still the shipped baseline. v0.3.0 tag waits for v0.3 fixture-sweep + adopter content; the Wave 2 compiler + BS-layer + Approach A spec anchor land mid-cycle.

**Cross-machine sync:** clean both repos at this snapshot. Worktrees: 4 retained for forensics (Wave 2 a + b + BS-layer + scrml-dev codegen + Approach A spec) — cleaned at wrap.

## S86 — what happened (so far)

### Phase 1 — Session-open ops + Approach A spec-amendment authorization scoping

Sync clean. Hand-off rotated. PA-SCRML-PRIMER + master-list §0 + last ~10 contentful user-voice entries read. Inbox empty.

User picked **v0.3 Wave 2 brief** from session-open menu. PA authored the brief at `docs/changes/v0.3-wave-2/DISPATCH-BRIEF.md` (~530 lines covering 2 parallel sub-dispatches: item (a) migrate + item (b) TAB extension, file-disjoint, worktree-isolated).

### Phase 2 — Wave 2 parallel dispatches (item a + item b)

Two background dispatches via `general-purpose` (Opus, worktree). File-disjoint.

**Item (a) `bun scrml migrate --program-shape`** landed at `885eaa9`:
- `compiler/src/commands/migrate.js` +1108 LOC (608 → ~1716).
- `classifyFile` helper extracted + unit-tested (5 buckets: entry / route / module / schema-anchor / ambiguous).
- `applyProgramShapeRewrite` per-bucket; safety harness reused (compileScrml roundtrip parse-check gate).
- `--dry-run --report` mode for structured advisory output.
- +33 tests + 5 fixtures (one per bucket).
- **Known limitation surfaced:** existing `sanityCheckParse` stages rewritten source into `/tmp` without relative-path context, so files with cross-file imports fail the safety gate even when the rewrite is semantically correct. Multi-file route files classified correctly in `--report` but NOT auto-rewritten until Wave 3 v0.3 fixture-sweep handles them with proper path context. Left as-is per brief §3.3.4 "Do not weaken this gate."

**Item (b) TAB extension** landed at `41a4706`:
- `compiler/src/ast-builder.js` extended in 4 orthogonal ways:
  1. `<page>` recognized as default-logic body container (`isPageRoot` OR-included in childContext).
  2. Top-level decl regex family extended for `function` / `fn` / `server function` / `type` / `let` / `const` + `export` prefix support.
  3. `W-PROGRAM-REDUNDANT-LOGIC` emission when `<program>` / `<page>` body wraps top-level decls in redundant `${...}` block.
  4. `<page>` per-route attr validation: `E-PAGE-INVALID-ATTR` + `E-PAGE-ROUTE-ATTR-FORBIDDEN`.
- +14 tests; **18 self-host parity tests `.skip`'d** pending self-host regen (deferred per pa.md S81 self-host-orthogonality).
- **Surprise surfaced:** BS-layer (`block-splitter.js:1161`) only recognizes V5-strict state-decl shape inside `<channel>` body — NOT `<program>` / `<page>`. Bare `<x>=0` inside `<program>`/`<page>` body STILL required `${...}` wrap despite SPEC §40.8 promising auto-lift. Spec-vs-implementation gap.

### Phase 3 — S86 user-voice ratifications (durable directives)

User surfaced two durable directives during a clarification turn:

1. **Idiomatic-examples styling rule:** *"while styles might be allowed outside `<program>`, it should be discouraged and never promoted in what should be idiomatic examples. the fact is I dont see 1 single reason to actully declare css there, css centralization always leads to untennable css."* — file-top `#{}` blocks SHALL NOT appear in kickstarter / primer worked examples / articles / fixture demos / dive worked examples. Inline `class="..."` Tailwind-style is canonical. `#{}` reserved for shapes that cannot express inline (CSS vars, keyframes, complex non-element selectors).
2. **Corpus-ouroboros warning (sharpening pa.md Rule 4):** *"agents that have no prior art on this language other than the examples of other agents (with no prior art) wrote. it becomes ouroborous if I dont constantly try to rangle the design in to conformance with my goals."* — corpus state is ARTIFACT, not EVIDENCE of design intent. SPEC + user-voice + pa.md are normative; pre-existing example/fixture content is NOT.

Memory file saved: `~/.claude/projects/-home-bryan-maclee-scrmlMaster-scrmlTS/memory/feedback_idiomatic_examples_styling.md`. Captured in user-voice S86 entry.

PA-side **DIRECTIVE-AMENDMENT-001-fixture-styling.md** authored + banner injected into Wave 2 brief while item (b) was running.

### Phase 4 — BS-layer extension (Option A — Wave 2 follow-up)

Item (b) surfaced the BS-layer gap. PA framed Option A (extend BS-layer to honor SPEC §40.8) vs Option B (amend SPEC to back down). User picked A: *"A. and we still have lots of work to do this session."*

**BS-layer extension landed at `2314c8c`:**
- `compiler/src/block-splitter.js` ~line 1161: 3 new locals (`isChannelBody` / `isProgramBody` / `isPageBody`) OR'd into existing peek guard.
- TAB-layer's `liftBareDeclarations` path was already wired by item (b); BS extension feeds directly.
- +19 tests (4 shapes × 2 contexts auto-lift; markup-opener disambiguation; regression on channel-body; SPEC §40.8 worked-example dual-form coverage).
- Durable rule recorded: when SPEC + impl diverge AND SPEC is design-intent shape, **impl catches up, NOT spec retreats**. Captured in user-voice + this hand-off.

### Phase 5 — PA-side cleanups (SPEC-INDEX + route-inference + changelog + master-list)

**SPEC-INDEX + route-inference cleanup at `4585b45`:**
- `compiler/SPEC-INDEX.md` auto-regen post-Wave-1 (58 row line-range refreshes).
- `compiler/src/route-inference.ts` `buildPageRouteTree` docstring clarified as AUTH-MIDDLEWARE path map (NOT canonical URL inference; canonical is §47.9.2 path-preserve). v0.4 follow-up to harmonize `routes/` keying with `pages/` corpus convention.

**Changelog + master-list S86 in-flight banner at `268867d`:**
- `docs/changelog.md` — full S86 entry capturing Wave 2 + BS-layer + S86 user-voice + libavif package-name correction.
- `master-list.md` — S86 IN-FLIGHT banner inserted above S85 CLOSE addendum.

### Phase 6 — scrml dev codegen divergence (Task #17 from S85)

User picked the depth-of-survey dispatch on Task #17. Agent fired background.

**Codegen fix landed at `41f7fe9`:**
- Important correction: **the "dev-vs-static divergence" framing was WRONG.** Both modes produce IDENTICAL broken output. Static-mode exits before loading; dev-mode loads via dynamic import where the JS engine surfaces SyntaxError. There is no `options.dev` branch in codegen.
- Error string was a paraphrase — S85 hand-off said `"Unexpected ."`; actual JS engine emits `"Unexpected -"` (kebab-case channel name in identifier position).
- Real bug: cross-file `<channel name="dispatch-board">` emitted as `import { dispatch-board } from "..."` — bare identifier with hyphen = invalid JS. Channels are inlined by CHX at consumer sites, NOT resolved via ES module bindings.
- Fix: new helper `filterChannelImportSpecifiers(stmt, importerPath, exportRegistry)` in `compiler/src/codegen/emit-channel.ts` (+98 LOC). Both `emit-server.ts:262` + `emit-client.ts:516` import-emit loops call the helper.
- **Bonus latent bug closed:** `{ X as Y }` was dropping `as Y` alias in emit. Test §C20.1.4 was locking in the buggy shape; corrected.
- +3 tests; 2 deferred items surfaced (trucking v0.3 channel-reversal migration → Wave 3 v0.3 territory; load-detail.client.js:285 lift-`<li>` text-template bug → separate small fix).

### Phase 7 — §40.8.1 OQ closed (Option C — "third option" methodology pattern)

User asked: *"do we have a debate planned for the spa multi-page questions? and Im not sure I ever layed eyes on results of logic by default inside `<program>` dd"*. PA confirmed Insight 29 ratified S85 (perf-feel debate done) + surfaced §40.8.1 OQ framing.

PA presented 3-option framing — Option A explicit `<program spa>`, Option B pure filesystem inference, Option C filesystem + `W-PROGRAM-SPA-INFERRED` info-level lint. User picked C: *"I like c."*

**§40.8.1 OQ CLOSED at `3f2504e`:**
- SPEC §40.8.1 status: OPEN QUESTION → RESOLVED.
- Verdict normative text: filesystem-inferred shape; NO `<program spa>` boolean attr.
- `W-PROGRAM-SPA-INFERRED` info lint fires when entry-file `<program>` + zero `<page>` siblings + no `pages/` directory at project root. Empty `pages/` dir suppresses.
- §34 +1 row.
- §40.8 §34 cross-ref updated.
- Methodology signal recorded: "third option" pattern — when binary OQ has real costs both sides, surfacing a synthesis option that captures both load-bearing benefits without their costs is often the right shape. Same pattern as Insight 22 test-bind middle path.

### Phase 8 — Perf-feel study dispatch (PA mistake caught by dispatch agent)

PA dispatched the perf-feel empirical study based on S86 hand-off carry-forward item 5 + S83 user-voice. **Dispatch agent caught a PA mistake: the study was ALREADY DONE at S84/S85 (Insight 29 ratified yesterday).** Same shape as the S82 IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP stale-carry-forward mistake. Agent correctly refused to write a duplicate doc.

Real state confirmed:
- S84 empirical study: `scrml-support/docs/diagnostics/reactive-graph-static-resolvability-S84.md` — 99-100% static-resolvable across trucking-dispatch + 02/06/08/14.
- Insight 29 ratification: `scrml-support/design-insights.md` ~line 1827.
- Approach A ratified for v0.3.0 spec-amendment target (300-640h band).
- Approach B deferred to v2. Approach D rejected.
- User's pre-empirical A+B lean: partially ratified, partially overturned (A confirmed; B flip-voted by llvm-pgo-expert).

**PA learning: extend Rule 4 (spec is normative; derived docs are NOT) to the hand-off carry-forward menu itself.** Carry-forward items are derived from past sessions; must verify against current truth (design-insights.md, master-list, etc.) before treating as live action items.

### Phase 9 — v0.3 Approach A spec-amendment authorization

User authorized "yes 1. spec-amend auth". PA scoped at `docs/changes/v0.3-approach-a-spec/SCOPING.md` with 4 PA-leans (synchronous-role-classification commit; §40.9 placement; MUST language on markup-edge emission; background general-purpose dispatch). User authorized "as scoped".

**Approach A spec anchor LANDED at `d3deed2`:**
- NEW §40.9 Closure Analysis (Minimal Playable Surface) — 12 sub-sections, ~430 LOC normative.
- NEW §40.1.1 Static role classification for closure analysis — resolves Insight 29 OQ #3 with synchronous-role-classification commit; async backend gates fall back to runtime ship-eagerly + `W-AUTH-RUNTIME-FALLBACK` info lint.
- §47.5 amendment — closure-analysis-determinism cross-reference; B-deferral language preserved.
- §52 + §41.9 cross-refs for Components 3 + 5.
- NEW PIPELINE.md Stage 7.6 Reachability Solver (spec anchor; renumbered from 7.5 because Stage 7.5 was already Batch Planner BP).
- §34 +2 rows: E-CLOSURE-001 (Error) + W-AUTH-RUNTIME-FALLBACK (Info).
- SPEC-INDEX regen post-merge.
- **Manual 3-way merge resolved** vs S86's prior §40.8.1 OQ closure (agent's branch based on `23e6265`; PA re-applied §40.8.1 RESOLVED + §34 W-PROGRAM-SPA-INFERRED on top of pulled SPEC.md surgically).

Compiler implementation of closure analysis is DEFERRED to subsequent waves (300-640h band). Zero compiler source touched in this dispatch.

### Phase 10 — WebKit unblock + Wave 3 D2 + D3 dispatched

WebKit binary downloaded + libavif16 installed (`libavif13` was wrong in S85 hand-off; corrected). **Wave 3 D1 now GREEN on all 3 browsers** — Chromium 5/5, Firefox 5/5, WebKit 5/5.

**Wave 3 D2 (4 critical-path Playwright tests) fired background:** TodoMVC + 03-contact-book + 05-multi-step-form + 14-mario. 10-16h walltime band.

**Wave 3 D3 (Phase B benchmarks refresh) fired background:** re-run benchmarks against current HEAD; update RESULTS.md + Version History; numbers-honesty audit (README line 429 + scrml.dev language). 6-12h walltime band.

### Phase 11 — Trucking-dispatch migration reconnaissance

PA ran `bun scrml migrate --program-shape --dry-run --report examples/23-trucking-dispatch/` for reconnaissance. Verdict:
- 36 files scanned.
- 4 would change auto-clean.
- 12 unchanged.
- **20 fail safety-harness** (cross-file-import limitation from item (a)).

Partial migration would leave trucking in mixed v0.2/v0.3 state — **right call: defer full migration to Wave 3 v0.3 fixture-sweep** when the safety-harness fix lands. Not part of S86 scope.

### Phase 12 — W-PROGRAM-SPA-INFERRED emission dispatch + landings

Small compiler-impl dispatch fired background to wire the lint per §40.8.1 normative statements. Landed at `4cd0b6a` with **filesystem-context guard** as load-bearing implementation detail (filePath must be absolute AND exist on disk) — initially broke 156 self-host parity tests because the lint fires on plain `<program>...</program>` shapes which ARE the parity-test corpus; mitigation aligns with SPEC ("fs-inspection-required") + excludes synthetic test paths. Surfaces meaningful design constraint: v0.3 walker family depends on real filesystem context. +9 tests.

### Phase 13 — Wave 3 v0.3 fixture-sweep SCOPING + reconnaissance

Trucking-dispatch `--dry-run --report` reconnaissance: 36 files scanned; 4 REWRITE auto-clean; 12 unchanged; **20 fail safety-harness** (cross-file-import limitation surfaced by item (a)). Right call: defer full sweep to a Wave 3 v0.3 dispatch when safety-harness fix lands.

SCOPING brief authored at `a918a3a` (~230 LOC; corpus inventory at S86 ground truth — 1031 .scrml in-repo, ~50-120 actually changing; Option A single-dispatch recommendation; pre-flight checklist gated on #13).

### Phase 14 — Wave 3 Playwright D2 (4 critical-path tests) — bombshell findings

Landed at `f32bd00`. **WebKit works fine** (Wave 3 scoping risk #4 RESOLVED with POSITIVE signal; identical pass/fail across Chromium / Firefox / WebKit; no `--no-hot-reload` flag needed). **4 distinct LATENT compiler-bug families surfaced** by faithful AC tests:

1. **14-mario:** bare `n` reference from enum-payload variant destructuring; structural-eq compares to whole enum object (`MarioState`) instead of variant (`MarioState.Small`).
2. **05-multi-step-form:** compiler emits literal `<InfoStep />` tags inside if-chain branches without inlining component body; match-arm `@currentStep = Step::Preferences` sets whole Step object instead of variant string.
3. **03-contact-book:** `<program auth="required">` gates server-fn routes by auth cookie; example has no working /login page; add-contact always 404s (likely fixture issue + auth-gate design).
4. **TodoMVC:** form-submit handler not propagating; edit-mode UI never rendered; 4 W-DEAD-FUNCTION + E-DG-002 in source.

These are V0.2.X-LATENT bugs that the existing happy-dom + Puppeteer harness completely missed because it uses generic "page renders something" checks. Faithful AC tests surface them immediately. E2E results: 19/96 pass, 66/96 fail. Filed for v0.2.x patch / Wave 3.5 triage. DB isolation via `spawnSync('bun', ['-e', ...])` — Playwright runs under Node; can't import bun:sqlite directly.

### Phase 15 — Wave 3 D3 (benchmarks refresh) crashed mid-investigation

D3a (afa1b84a0999559d9) crashed mid-investigation. PA pre-cleanup gate (pa.md S83 `status --short` non-empty → STOP) HELD — worktree retained for forensics; salvage diagnosed instead of deletion-cascade.

Surfaced finding (load-bearing): **`benchmarks/bench-scrml.js` lines 82-96 IIFE-eval pattern is broken against v0.2.6+** — internal runtime symbols (`let`-scoped) not reachable from client IIFE because explicit window-export list doesn't cover all v0.2.6+ codegen symbols. D3a attempted indirect-eval refactor `(0, eval)(combinedScript)` but never verified. runtime-results.json was overwritten with empty scrml results.

Crash-diagnosis doc landed at `24af6a2`. D3b re-dispatch queued (Task #14).

### Phase 16 — Migrate safety-harness cross-file-import fix (Task #13)

Depth-of-survey dispatch picked **Option β (transactional in-place rewrite + verify + restore)** over γ (parse-only) — preserves full-fidelity safety check; smallest mechanical change. Rewritten `sanityCheckParse` reads + backs up original; atomic-writes rewrite to original path; runs compileScrml from project root (cross-file imports resolve naturally); `try/finally` always restores from in-memory backup. Crash window microseconds.

Validation: trucking-dispatch `--dry-run --report` shows **24 REWRITE + 12 failed** (vs pre-fix 4 + 20). The 12 remaining are real v0.3 E-CHANNEL-OUTSIDE-PROGRAM spec violations from imported v0.2 channel files (Wave 3 fixture-sweep target). Unblocks Wave 3 v0.3 sweep.

Out-of-scope follow-up surfaced: `promote.js:442` has identical staged-tmp pattern — same problem will hit `bun scrml promote --match` on multi-file fixtures.

### Phase 17 — Wrap operations (current)

- Final test run: **11,593 / 0 fail / 563 files** ✅
- Inbox empty ✅
- **117 worktrees cleaned** at wrap (S83 hit 30; S86 wrap crossed 100). 26 retained with residue (untracked node_modules / bun.lock rollbacks / agent diagnostic probes / .bak files) — pa.md S83 literal rule says STOP on non-empty status; retained for safety. 1 worktree explicitly preserved: D3a per crash-recovery rule.
- Cross-machine sync: 15 commits ahead of origin (push pending; surface for authorization).

### Wave 3 status

- D1 (Playwright infra + 02-counter canary) — LANDED S85 at `f69ff6a`; now GREEN on all 3 browsers (Chromium / Firefox / WebKit)
- D2 (TodoMVC + 03-contact-book + 05-multi-step-form + 14-mario) — IN FLIGHT
- D3 (benchmarks refresh) — IN FLIGHT

### v0.3 phase tracker

- **Wave 1 — SPEC anchor + walker inversion** — LANDED S85 `2b7c4df`. §40.8 + §40.8.1 (S86 RESOLVED) + §4.15 + §38.1 + §47.9.2 + §34 +5 codes + walker.
- **Wave 2 — compiler implementation** — LANDED S86. Item (a) migrate `885eaa9` + Item (b) TAB `41a4706` + BS-layer follow-up `2314c8c`.
- **Approach A spec anchor** — LANDED S86 `d3deed2`. §40.9 closure-analysis spec + PIPELINE Stage 7.6 + §40.1.1 static role classification.
- **W-PROGRAM-SPA-INFERRED impl** — IN FLIGHT (Task #10 dispatch).
- **Wave 3 — fixture migration sweep** — DEFERRED (gated on safety-harness cross-file-import fix; reconnaissance shows 20/36 trucking files fail current safety gate).
- **Wave 4 — adopter content + tutorials** — PENDING.
- **Closure-analysis compiler implementation** — DEFERRED to subsequent waves (300-640h band per Insight 29).

### Worktree state at S86 close

**117 worktrees cleaned this wrap.** Pre-S86 worktrees had accumulated across MANY prior sessions (S83 hit 30; this wrap crossed 100). pa.md S83 wrap §6b discipline applied: per-worktree status --short gate held → 117 clean worktrees removed cleanly + branch -D + prune. **26 worktrees retained** with residue (status --short non-empty per S83 literal rule — STOP on dirty):

- Sample of retained dirty worktrees inspected: untracked `node_modules` / modified `bun.lock` (post-`bun install` rollback noise) / agent diagnostic probes (`_probe_*.mjs`) / backup files (`SPEC.md.bak`). **NOT at-risk work** per inspection — agent residue from prior dispatches whose actual work landed in main in their respective sessions.
- **1 worktree explicitly preserved** for genuine at-risk work: `agent-afa1b84a0999559d9` (D3a — crashed mid-investigation; uncommitted bench-scrml.js refactor + emptied runtime-results.json; surfaced finding captured at `24af6a2`).

**pa.md S83 rule sharpening candidate** for S87+: distinguish residue (regeneratable; node_modules / bun.lock / probes / .bak) from at-risk-work (compiler source / docs / tests modified). The current literal-rule "STOP on any non-empty status" prevents loss but also retains regeneratable noise across sessions indefinitely. Refine to:
- Auto-clean residue patterns (node_modules / bun.lock-only changes / *.mjs probe files / *.bak / *.tmp / *_*.patch).
- Retain on at-risk-work pattern (compiler/src/* / docs/* / *.scrml / *.md modifications).
- Or: explicit allowlist of "clean if only these globs are dirty" patterns.

Pre-commit hook: `core.hooksPath = scripts/git-hooks` verified holding at close.

---

## In-flight threads at S86 close

NONE. All 4 in-flight dispatches returned + landed (W-PROGRAM-SPA-INFERRED + Wave 3 D2 + Migrate safety-harness) OR were diagnosed-as-crashed (Wave 3 D3a).

---

## Open questions to surface immediately at S87 open

1. **Wave 3 fixture-sweep for v0.3 program-shape** — gated on safety-harness cross-file-import fix. Reconnaissance done; full sweep is its own dispatch.
2. **load-detail.client.js:285 lift-`<li>` text-template inline bug** — surfaced by scrml-dev codegen fix. Separate small dispatch.
3. **Compiler implementation of closure analysis** — Approach A spec anchor LANDED; 300-640h impl band waits in queue for subsequent v0.3 waves. Probably v0.3.x sub-waves OR v0.4.0 depending on user sequencing.
4. **`<program spa>` OQ:** CLOSED at `3f2504e` (Option C — filesystem inference + W-PROGRAM-SPA-INFERRED lint). Lint impl is in-flight.
5. **Self-host regen + re-enable 18 deferred parity tests** — deferred per pa.md S81 self-host-orthogonality; post-v1.0.0.
6. **Articles publishable per S84 W2-3 triage** — user-decision-queue; not auto-publish.

---

## Things S87 PA must NOT screw up (S86 additions to the standing list)

- **DO NOT re-fire the perf-feel empirical study or the perf-feel debate.** Insight 29 ratified at S85 (`scrml-support/design-insights.md` line 1827; S84 diagnostic at `scrml-support/docs/diagnostics/reactive-graph-static-resolvability-S84.md`). Hand-off / master-list carry-forward items can be STALE — verify against design-insights.md + master-list §0 phase tracker before treating as live action.
- **DO NOT attempt partial trucking-dispatch v0.3 migration.** Reconnaissance shows 20/36 files fail the safety-harness gate; partial migration leaves trucking in mixed v0.2/v0.3 state. Wave 3 v0.3 fixture-sweep is the canonical sweep wave; lands when safety-harness cross-file-import fix lands.
- **DO note that `<program spa>` is CLOSED.** The OQ at SPEC §40.8.1 is RESOLVED Option C. Do not re-debate; do not pre-commit a marker; lint surfaces the inference.
- **DO note Approach A spec anchor is LIVE.** §40.9 closure analysis + §40.1.1 static role classification + PIPELINE Stage 7.6 Reachability Solver + §34 +2 codes. Compiler implementation is subsequent waves (300-640h band). When dispatching closure-analysis impl work, cite §40.9 normative statements verbatim.
- **DO apply the corpus-ouroboros warning** (S86 ratification) when reasoning about design calls. "The corpus does X" is DATA, not REASONING. Re-derive from intent (SPEC + user-voice + pa.md).
- **DO apply the idiomatic-examples styling rule** (S86 ratification) when authoring scrml in articles / dives / fixtures / kickstarter examples. Inline `class=` Tailwind-style; NO file-top `#{}`.
- **DO surface stale-carry-forward risk at session-open.** When carry-forward menu shows action items, verify each against current truth (design-insights.md / master-list / SPEC) before treating as actionable.
- **DO note Stage 7.5 vs Stage 7.6.** PIPELINE.md Stage 7.5 is Batch Planner (BP). Stage 7.6 is Reachability Solver (S86 Approach A spec anchor). Don't conflate.
- **DO note 4 retained worktrees at snapshot** (5+ if more dispatches fire). All cleaned at wrap.

### Rules permanently load-bearing (from session-open hand-off — unchanged)

- Rule 1 — no marketing/article/tweet work unless user brings it up.
- Rule 2 — scrml is not a toy/hobby language; full-production-language fidelity.
- Rule 3 — right answer beats easy answer 99.999% of the time.
- Rule 4 — spec is normative; derived planning docs are NOT. **S86 extension:** the hand-off carry-forward menu itself is derived; verify against design-insights.md / master-list before acting.

## Memory files updated S86

- NEW `feedback_idiomatic_examples_styling.md` — file-top `#{}` never canonical in examples; corpus is artifact NOT evidence of intent. Captured from S86 ratifications.
- NEW `MEMORY.md` index — first entry pointing to feedback_idiomatic_examples_styling.md (the dir was previously empty).

## Cross-machine sync state at snapshot

- **scrmlTS:** unpushed since session-open. 9 commits ahead of origin/main (Wave 2 + BS-layer + SPEC-INDEX + changelog + scrml-dev + scoping + §40.8.1 OQ + Approach A + soon W-PROGRAM-SPA-INFERRED + Wave 3 D2 + D3). Push pending at wrap.
- **scrml-support:** S86 user-voice append + 0 other writes. Push pending at wrap.
- **Worktree state:** 8 worktrees retained for forensics; cleaned at wrap.
- **Pre-commit hook:** `core.hooksPath = scripts/git-hooks` verified on main; per-worktree enabled per dispatch via brief addendum.
