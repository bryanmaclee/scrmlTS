/**
 * E-SQL-009 — CONCISE / CURRIED arrow-body `?{}` SQL detection (issue #12 blast
 * radius; the S215-class completion of the S220 emit-server diagnostic).
 *
 * The PRIMARY E-SQL-009 site (emit-server.ts ~:1599) catches a `?{}` SQL block
 * inside a BLOCK-body arrow / function-expression, which parses as a single
 * opaque escape-hatch whose `.raw` carries the `?{`...`}` text. That detection
 * MISSES the CONCISE-body arrow shapes — so this pass closes the gap for them:
 *
 *   S5  concise direct      const ins = (x) => ?{`…`}.run()
 *   S11 concise return      return (x) => ?{`…`}.run()
 *   S13 concise in callback [1,2,3].map(x => ?{`…`}.run())
 *   S4  curried             const f = (a) => (b) => { ?{`…`}.run() }
 *   S9  curried multi-stmt  const f = (a) => (b) => { log(a); ?{`…`}.run() }
 *
 * Detection (the single "Case B" text scan): the full source of the offending
 * arrow survives verbatim on the retained `.init` / `.expr` / `.raw` text of some
 * node, so a `?{`…` SQL opener inside a concise-body arrow region is found by
 * scanning that text — see conciseArrowBodyHasSql.
 *
 * HISTORY (Case A removal — g-detect-sql-case-a-prune, 2026-06-27). The S5/S11
 * direct-decl / return forms USED to need a second "Case A" detector: pre-ss50 the
 * live parser's `collectExpr` broke at the SQL BLOCK_REF (ast-builder.js depth-0
 * statement boundary), leaving a dangling `( x ) =>` ParseError escape-hatch and
 * the `?{}` ORPHANED as a sibling `sql` node — so the `.raw` text carried no SQL
 * signature and Case B could not see it. Case A keyed on that orphaned shape
 * (a node whose retained text ends with `=>` immediately followed by a sibling
 * `sql` node). The ss50 item-1 parser fix (commit 2fca8075, ast-builder.js)
 * SUPPRESSED that break when the last collected token is the arrow glyph `=>`, so
 * the concise `?{}` body is now captured into the SAME escape-hatch `.raw` the
 * block-body form produces. The orphaned-sibling shape is therefore no longer
 * produced; Case A was proven dead (0 fires across the full suite + corpus while
 * all of S5/S11/S13/S4/S9 fire cleanly via Case B) and removed.
 *
 * All of these otherwise leak as the generic E-CODEGEN-INVALID-JS ("compiler
 * defect, please report it"). Worse, when the enclosing fn does NOT escalate to
 * server (a curried `?{}` two arrows deep — S4 — stays client), the malformed
 * fragment is emitted into the CLIENT bundle and emit-server never runs at all.
 * So this detection lives in a parser-agnostic post-AST walk wired at TAB (api.js),
 * which runs for EVERY file REGARDLESS of server-escalation, and reuses the SAME
 * E-SQL-009 message + remedy as the emit-server site.
 *
 * Braced-body arrows are intentionally NOT handled here (emit-server already
 * covers them via the escape-hatch `.raw`); the `=>`-not-followed-by-`{` concise
 * gate keeps the two sites DISJOINT (no double-fire) — see conciseArrowBodyHasSql.
 *
 * SCOPE — LIVE pipeline only. The detection reads the `.init` / `.expr` / `.raw`
 * TEXT the live (Acorn) ast-builder retains verbatim. Under `--parser=scrml-native`
 * (strictly opt-in, default null) those fields are backfilled from the mangled
 * structured exprNode and may omit the `?{`...` signature, so a concise/curried
 * SQL-in-arrow can false-NEGATIVE on the native path. That is acceptable: native
 * is the swap-grind opt-in, the live pipeline is the canonical enforcer, and issue
 * #12 is a live-pipeline bug. No crash either way (the walk is null-safe).
