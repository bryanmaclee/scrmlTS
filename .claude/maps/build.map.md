## Build & Release

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| scripts/compile-test-samples.sh | Pretest hook: compiles all samples/compilation-tests/ before test run |
| scripts/regen-spec-index.ts | Regenerates SPEC-INDEX.md section table from SPEC.md headings |
| scripts/update-spec-index.sh | Print-only helper listing current SPEC.md heading line numbers |
| scripts/rebuild-bs-dist.ts | Rebuilds block-splitter dist artifact |
| scripts/rebuild-tab-dist.ts | Rebuilds TAB (tokenizer+ast-builder) dist artifact |
| scripts/rebuild-self-host-dist.ts | Rebuilds self-host compiler dist |
| scripts/bundle-size-benchmark.js | Measures emitted bundle sizes |
| scripts/perf-regression-check.ts | Runs timing regression check against perf baseline |
| scripts/state.ts | **DD3 project-state tool (S172, NEW +329).** `bun scripts/state.ts` prints state-at-HEAD: gap counts by severity (from `docs/known-gaps.md` `@gap` tokens), bun-test subset pass/skip/fail, version, inventory, last-N `wrap(s…)` anchors, maps-staleness. `--write` regenerates in-repo `@generated:*` sections; `--check` is the currency gate — exit 1 on stale `@generated`; maps-staleness is WARN-only. This is the wrap step 6d generator. **GEN_SECTIONS** (2 entries S173): (1) `gap-counts` → known-gaps §0 `\| Severity \| Open \|` data rows from `@gap` tokens; (2) **`recent-sessions` (NEW S173, DD3 Fork 1)** → master-list §0.6 generated index (last-8 `wrap(s…)` anchors + push-state + tag-cut) via `recentSessions(8)` [scripts/state.ts:272]. Per-session narrative SoT is `docs/changelog.md`; §0.6 is the startup-load-bearing forensic index only. |

## CI/CD Pipeline
No .github/workflows/ directory detected — no automated CI/CD configured.
Pre-commit hook: scripts/git-hooks/ — runs `bun test` before every commit (--no-verify is prohibited).

## Pre-commit Hook
Location: scripts/git-hooks/ (installed via git hooks config)
Behavior: runs the full test suite; blocks commits on failures.
