# scrml — Recent Fixes & Work In Flight

A rolling log of what just landed and what's actively underway in the compiler. For the full spec and pipeline docs see `compiler/SPEC.md` and `compiler/PIPELINE.md`.

Baseline (2026-04-14): **6,153 tests passing / 14 failing** (all 14 are pre-existing, non-blocking — environment issues, self-host build step, edge cases).

## Recently Landed

### 2026-04-14

- **Match-as-expression (§18.3)** — `const x = match expr { .A => v else => d }` now works end-to-end. Follows the same pattern as `if`/`for` as expressions.
- **`:>` match arm arrow** — codegen support complete. Both `=>` and `:>` are canonical; `->` retained as a legacy alias. `:>` avoids overloading JS arrow-function syntax and reads as "narrows to."
- **`</>` closer propagation** — the 2026-04-09 spec amendment (bare `/` → `</>`) was incompletely applied; the AST builder still accepted bare `/` as a tag closer. Now uniformly enforced across parser, codegen, and all 11 affected sample files.
- **Lift Approach C Phase 1** — `parseLiftTag` produces structured markup AST nodes directly during parsing. Previously 0% of real inline lift markup went through the structured path; now it's 100%. The fragile markup re-parse path is dead in production (retained only for legacy test fixtures pending Phase 3).
- **Phase 4d (ExprNode-first migration)** — all compiler consumers now read structured `ExprNode` fields first, with string-expression fields deprecated across 20+ AST interfaces. Expression handling is now AST-driven end-to-end.

## In Flight

- **Phase 3 — Legacy test fixture migration.** ~21 fixtures still use the old `{kind: "expr", expr: "..."}` shape. Rewriting them unlocks deletion of ~250–300 LOC of dead string-parsing fallback code in `emit-lift.js`.
- **Lin Approach B (discontinuous scoping).** Design complete, spec amendments drafted. Multi-session work to land an enriched `lin` model beyond Rust-style exact-once consumption.
- **SPEC sync.** Formalizing the `:>` match arm, match-as-expression, and Lift Approach C changes in `compiler/SPEC.md`.

---

## Queued

- **Phase 2 reactive effects** — two-level effect separation for `if`/`lift`. Design settled; will land when a concrete example drives the need.
- **SQL batching (compiler-level).** Two wins on the table:
  - *Per-request coalescing* — independent `?{}` queries in one server function get emitted together, one prepare/lock cycle instead of N.
  - *N+1 loop hoisting* — detect `for (let x of xs) { ?{...WHERE id=${x.id}}.get() }` and rewrite to a single `WHERE id IN (...)` fetched once before the loop. This is only tractable because the compiler owns both the query context and the loop context.
  - Cross-call DataLoader-style batching is parked until beta.
- **Remaining 14 test failures** — triaged, pre-existing, none block beta.
