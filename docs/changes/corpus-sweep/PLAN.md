# Corpus Compilation + Runtime Sweep — PLAN

**Authored S120 (2026-05-22).** Not yet executed — this is the plan; the sweep
runs later, on the trigger below.

## Why

Two compounding problems:

1. **The ouroboros.** Broken artifacts accumulate in the corpus and get cited
   as truth — examples, samples, README blocks, kickstarter snippets. A wrong
   artifact becomes the basis for the next thing. (User concern, S86 / S88 /
   S115; restated S120.)
2. **Every gate is compile-only.** The README gate, the pre-commit hook, the
   examples — all check that source *compiles*, none check that the output
   *runs*. `scrml compile` can exit 0 and emit broken JavaScript.

S120 surfaced how wide that gap is. The README's full-stack hero compiled
clean and was pushed live — then failed in the browser (`?{}` SQL un-lowered
into the client bundle, `nodeId=-1`). Diagnosing it showed
`examples/03-contact-book.scrml` — the flagship full-stack example — also
fails at runtime (`loadContacts is not a function` — a server fn called in a
render loop, not awaited; 403 CSRF). The full-stack DB story has multiple
runtime bugs that no gate sees.

A large compile **+ runtime** sweep of the whole corpus is overdue.

## Timing — the trigger

Do **not** run the full sweep yet, and do **not** mass-fix corpus bugs yet.

The native front-end rebuild (charter B — replace block-splitter + Acorn with
the native parser) is near its tail. M5 landed S119 (`--parser=scrml-native`
routable, 949/1000 canary). M6 deletes Acorn + the block-splitter and makes the
native parser the sole front-end.

**The native parser is the basis we will be fixing upon.** Fixing corpus bugs
against the current BS+Acorn front-end risks wasted work — the native parser
may compile the same source differently. Per the user (S120): *"it would make
sense not to fix too much until we know what basis we are fixing upon."*

**Trigger:** the full sweep runs once the native front-end is the sole/default
front-end (M6 — or M5 once `--parser=scrml-native` is trustworthy enough to
sweep against). Until then:

- Note bugs; do not mass-fix.
- **Exception:** an acute, public-facing falsehood (e.g., the S120 README hero
  claiming a broken app "runs") is fixed immediately — honestly and minimally,
  README/doc-only, no compiler change.

## Scope

| Surface | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `examples/` | 27 single-file + `23-trucking-dispatch` + `22-multifile` | the highest-visibility corpus |
| `samples/compilation-tests/` | ~289 | compile-only is acceptable for most; spot-run the representative ones |
| README `​```scrml` blocks | 4 | already gated on compile; add runtime |
| `docs/articles/llm-kickstarter-v2-*.md` snippets | — | the dev-agent canon; high blast radius |
| `stdlib/*.scrml` | 16 | import-only — compile-check in an importing harness |

## Method — per artifact

1. **Compile** — capture errors + warnings, AND inspect the output bundle for
   the silent-failure tells: `nodeId=-1` / `sql-ref unresolved` / `? { … }`
   un-lowered SQL / empty (`~3-line`) client bundles / `please report`
   comments. A clean exit code is NOT sufficient.
2. **Run** — start a dev server, drive the page with Playwright: load, assert
   no `pageerror` / `console.error`, interact (submit forms, click buttons),
   assert the expected DOM change. This is the new axis the corpus has never
   had.
3. **Classify** each artifact:
   - `PASS` — compiles clean + runs clean.
   - `COMPILE-BROKEN` — error, or silent broken-output tell.
   - `RUNTIME-BROKEN` — compiles, breaks in the browser.
   - `CORPUS-STALE` — artifact uses outdated/invalid scrml (migration backlog,
     not a compiler bug).
4. **Triage** — separate **compiler bugs** (valid scrml → bad output) from
   **corpus-stale** (artifact's fault). The gauntlet-overseer distinction.

## The gate gap to close (deliverable, not optional)

The sweep is a snapshot; the gate is the ratchet. Add a **runtime smoke-test**:

- Extend `scripts/extract-readme-scrml.js` (README gate) — after compile, run
  the block headless and assert no JS errors.
- A corpus runtime harness — `examples/` driven through dev-server + Playwright
  in CI / pre-push.
- Consider a machine-verified-runtime tier alongside the user-verified
  `examples/VERIFIED.md`.

Without this, the ouroboros refills.

## Seed bug ledger (found S120 — to confirm against the native-parser basis)

1. `?{}` SQL with no `<db>` element → un-lowered into the client bundle,
   `nodeId=-1`, **compile exits 0**. Should be a clean `E-` error, not silent
   broken output.
2. `<entry>` compound-state element inside a `<db>` body → **empty output**
   (whole body silently dropped).
3. `E-PA-002` fires even when the source includes the `CREATE TABLE` statement
   the error message itself prescribes as the fix.
4. A `server function` called inside a render `for`-loop → `… is not a
   function or its return value is not iterable` at runtime (CPS/await of the
   server call not handled). — `examples/03-contact-book.scrml`.
5. `403 Forbidden` on the server-fn `fetch` (CSRF) — `examples/03` runtime.
6. Realtime `<channel>` server fn reading a channel cell (`@entries`) → the
   server handler reads `_scrml_body["entries"]` that the client never sends.
7. **Gate blind spot** — compile-only gates pass compile-but-broken-JS.

Bugs 1-6 are provisional: re-confirm each against the native-parser front-end
once it is the basis — some may change shape or vanish; new ones will surface.

## Deliverables

1. A sweep report — full compile + runtime matrix per artifact.
2. A bug ledger — compiler bugs vs corpus-stale, prioritized.
3. The runtime gate upgrade (above).
4. A corpus-fix campaign decomposition — dispatched against the native-parser
   basis.
