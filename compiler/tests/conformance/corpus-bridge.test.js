/**
 * Conformance corpus GATE bridge (D-1).
 *
 * The impl-agnostic conformance corpus lives at the TOP-LEVEL `conformance/`
 * dir (SCOPE OQ5 — the suite's eventual cross-impl home), which is OUTSIDE
 * bunfig.toml's `[test] root = "compiler/tests/"` and so is NOT auto-discovered
 * by the root-restricted pre-commit gate. This thin bridge — which DOES live
 * under the gated root — imports the corpus runner and asserts EVERY case
 * passes, so the corpus rides the existing pre-commit suite without modifying
 * bunfig.toml (per the D-1 dispatch brief).
 *
 * One test() per case (each well under the 10s per-test timeout). Asserts both
 * halves the corpus runner checks:
 *   (a) CODES — required-code PRESENCE + forbidden-code/forbidden-prefix
 *       ABSENCE + per-code §34 SEVERITY (the cross-stream-honest partition); and
 *   (b) RUNTIME — when the case declares input/dom/domAnchored/state, the
 *       post-run normalized DOM + state snapshot satisfy the contract
 *       (compile + execute in happy-dom — see conformance/adapters/impl1-ts.ts).
 *
 * The corpus is DETERMINISTIC (settle-based; no real-time waits) — verified
 * stable across repeated runs before gating.
