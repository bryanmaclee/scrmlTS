# scrml — deputy state (re-hydration anchor)

**Created S203 (2026-06-17).** The vPA deputy's durable re-hydration anchor — a fresh deputy re-boots
off THIS file + the delta-log + the maintenance read-list (cheap + lossless: the deputy does projection,
not deliberation, so nothing irreplaceable lives in its transcript; `scrml-support/vpa-scrml.md`
§"Re-hydration"). **Deputy-owned** (write-surface partition); maintained on the `deputy-maint` branch.

> **REBOOT-READY anchor refreshed at tick 86 (S209).** A fresh deputy: open a 2nd terminal in `scrml`,
> say **"read vpa.md and boot"** → maintenance boot → FF the existing `deputy-maint` worktree → read
> this file + the delta-log tail → resume the `/loop 30m` self-poke. Resume point below.

## Deputy status (RESUME POINT)

- **State:** LIVE — steady-state. **S209 active** (S208 wrapped: g-pure-module HIGH closed; sPA execution-agent role + dock-health tool built). flogence (renamed from flogeance S206). On tick 86 (next fresh deputy starts at T87).
- **Self-poke loop:** `/loop 30m` — cron job `39fed15c` (`7,37 * * * *`). **A fresh deputy must re-arm its own `/loop`** (the cron dies with the old instance). CronDelete `39fed15c` to cancel the old one if still alive.
- **Last-absorbed delta seq:** S209 **[6]** (PA-source; the deputy itself appended the S205 F3 entry [22]).
- **`deputy-maint` branch:** worktree `/home/bryan-maclee/scrmlMaster/scrml-deputy-maint` (scrmlMaster sibling, OUTSIDE `.claude/worktrees/`). **Tip:** `git rev-parse deputy-maint`. FF onto main at boot.
- **node_modules:** the worktree already has the symlinks (re-create if missing): `ln -s …/scrml/node_modules ./node_modules` · `…/scrml/compiler/node_modules ./compiler/node_modules`.
- **Owed maintenance:** none. (digest current head=72dc4fdb; maps watermark `9afc746e`; §0 + recent-sessions PASS; §3c green.)
- **Coherence:** deputy-maint `0 1` ahead of main (tick-86, awaiting the PA's next integration — clean FF).

## The deputy tick (steady-state — what each `/loop` fire does)

1. `cd` the worktree; `git merge --ff-only main` (if NOT clean FF → `git rebase main`; a cross-cutting rename → reset+rebuild per "Lessons").
2. Re-check the delta-log + `bun scripts/state.ts` oracle AFTER syncing (a pre-sync read misses new entries).
3. Absorb new PA-source delta entries; act on `(vpa: …)` only if maintenance-shaped; DECLINE/route anything deliberation-shaped.
4. Owed maintenance: `state.ts --write` (§0 if stale) · `state.ts --digest` (if a projected source moved) · maps refresh (see cadence) · re-emit flograph.
5. **§3c health check** (every tick): `flograph.ts --check --with-support --with-archive` · `dock.ts --check` · `dock.ts --coverage` → record a one-line snapshot; route only NEW findings (new currency-sweep hit · dock ERROR · new load-bearing dangling decided-by/cites · flograph dup-id). A drift ERROR you FIX by re-emitting.
6. **F3** (monitor agents): `ls .claude/worktrees/` + `git -C <agent-wt> log/status`. Append a `(deputy) state` delta entry ONLY when an agent COMPLETED CLEANLY and the PA is absent/rebooting/deferred-to-F3. A crashed/partial agent is NOT a completion. NEVER land (PA S67 file-delta).
7. Commit each to `deputy-maint` (never main); update this file (heartbeat + ACK + watch + owed); report "absorbed through [M]; deputy-maint at <SHA>; owed: <list|none>".

## PA↔vPA protocol — ACK + HEARTBEAT (S205 [19], each tick)

- **heartbeat:** tick **T86** · last-absorbed **[S209 6]** · deputy-maint tip = `git rev-parse deputy-maint`.
- **ACK (vpa:) [S205 10]** → §3c health-check each tick (standing). **ACK (vpa:) [S205 19]** → ACK+heartbeat each tick (standing). No new `(vpa:)` in S206-S209.

## Standing facts (durable)

- **Merge-before-push gate (S205 [15], pa.md S199 + wrap step 7):** the PA asserts `deputy-maint ^main == 0` before any push — integrates the deputy each cycle. Working.
- **F1 dilation REALIZED:** F1 ~8.3k start-thinning when the digest boots current; total deputy dilation ~14-15k/cycle ≈ 1.5%/1M (NOT the design-time 7-10% — frame-conflation corrected S204/S205). Net-positive. S209 cold-boot was digest-thinned ([S209 1]); S208 was NOT (PA misread the deputy as down → skipped the boot-merge → stale digest → read the heartbeat to know the deputy is alive).
- **S42 WRAP-THINNING (S205 [19]):** PA wraps reference digest/delta-log/deputy-state for mechanical content (deputy-enabled).
- **Block-analysis-emit v1 arc COMPLETE (S206-S208):** D1 footprint + D2 builder + D3 emit-wiring + D4 dock-consumer + D5 span-fix; block-lease groundwork. dock-health.ts (codebase-health surface) built S209.

## Lessons (operational — avoid re-learning)

- **Maps mechanism (T12, user-ruled no-consent):** dispatch `project-mapper` INTO the deputy-maint worktree (CWD-pinned, worktree-only-path brief, NO isolation) + independently verify `git -C <main> status --porcelain -- .claude/maps/` is EMPTY before committing. project-mapper > manual (it catches new E-/W-codes a manual edit misses — T76/T82).
- **Maps refresh RULE (firm):** refresh when — a WRAP boundary with any compiler-src owed · OR ≥2 changes accumulate · OR an owed change has sat ≥10 ticks. Else BATCH (each run ~100-130k sub-agent tokens; PA-window saving only ~6-7k → minimize runs).
- **maps-owed scope:** `examples/**/*.scrml` + `samples/**/*.scrml` — NOT bare `**/*.scrml` (catches docs/changes/ fixtures = false signal, T37).
- **Digest:** regen ONLY when a projected source (known-gaps/delta-log/maps/version) moved; regen the tick AFTER a bundled maps+digest commit (the stamp lags its own commit otherwise — T51/T77).
- **Partition-breach (T44):** a cross-cutting text-rename touches deputy-owned files → rebase conflict. Resolve by reset deputy-maint to the renamed main + rebuild (deputy commits are regenerable — no info loss).
- **PA fast-burst:** the PA may skip §0/maps and may not delta-log a burst → deputy regens §0 + git-infers agent/landing state (T54/T76).
- **perl -e:** NO apostrophes in replacement text (a single-quote terminates the `perl -e '...'` string — T52); use `{}` delimiters; escape `/`; heredoc-rewrite is the reliable fallback. **delta-log edits:** use python (backticks break the shell).
- **CWD slip:** Bash CWD resets to MAIN after each command — `cd` the worktree (or `git -C`) before worktree ops. **Untracked new file:** `git add` before commit. `docs/graph/` is gitignored.
- **Commit gate:** pre-commit WARNS on non-main + runs the ~17k subset (~75-120s); deputy commits are derived-only → always pass; never `--no-verify`. `git rebase` does NOT run the gate.

## Graph/dock health (§3c)

- **Snapshot @ tick 86 (PASS):** flograph ~428n/103e (--with-support --with-archive) · currency-sweep **0 (clean — the ouroboros catch holds)** · ~30 unverified · ~29 dangling · 0 dup · 0 err. dock --check PASS · coverage 0/628 (0.0%) · 0 orphans. dangling/unverified track new S206-S209 design docs — no NEW finding.
- **route to PA (open nit):** §3 plain `flograph --emit` vs §3c `--check --with-support --with-archive` → graph.json drifts to the 190n default; the deputy compensates by emitting with the matching flags. Align §3 with §3c (or make --check corpus-aware).

## In-flight dispatches (F3 watch list)

- _(none in flight)_ — all S205-S208 agents landed + 6b-cleaned. The g-pure-module HIGH crash→S208-salvage loop closed (432c28b6).

## Currency snapshot (@ tick 86)

- **maps:** watermark `9afc746e` (REFRESHED T82) — current (no mapped-corpus change since). **digest:** current (head `72dc4fdb`, delta-seq S209 6). **§0:** gap-counts + recent-sessions PASS. **§3c:** PASS.

## Maintenance seams (Function 2)

- `.claude/maps/*` — `project-mapper` into the worktree + main-clean verify; watermark `.claude/maps/primary.map.md` (`9afc746e`).
- `docs/changelog.md` · `@generated` §0 (`docs/known-gaps.md`) + `master-list.md` §0.6 — `bun scripts/state.ts --write` (gate `--check`).
- `handOffs/digest.md` — `bun scripts/state.ts --digest` (F1). · flograph `scripts/flograph.ts` · dock `scripts/dock.ts` + `scripts/dock-health.ts` (§3c) · block-lease (groundwork built; not wired).

## Cross-refs

- `scrml/vpa.md` (root stub → boot phrase) · `scrml-support/vpa-scrml.md` — the deputy contract (§3 steady-state + §3c + S205 ACK+heartbeat + "Operating the live system"). · `pa-scrml.md` §"S199 addendum" — PA-side (gate, ACK/heartbeat read at boot+integration).
- `handOffs/delta-log.md` — the live PA-state stream. · `docs/deep-dives/vpa-deputy-reframe-2026-06-17.md` — the design.
