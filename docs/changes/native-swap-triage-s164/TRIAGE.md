# Native-Parser-Swap Flip-Failure Triage — S164 (631 remaining)

**Date:** 2026-06-04 · **HEAD at triage:** `e9d1f3cb` · **Method:** read-only diagnostic agent, every family reproduced with `bun compiler/bin/scrml.js compile <fixture>` (default exit 0 vs `--parser=scrml-native` fail/miscompile). Surface error codes were misleading on 3/7 families → grouped by **native parse-gap ROOT**, not error code.

**Status:** the top recommendation (lift-closetag) LANDED `649f4ef8`; F2 SQL in flight. This doc is the next-pick map for the autonomous swap-grind loop.

## Ranked family table

| Family | ~count | Native ROOT divergence | Native locus | single/multi | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **lift `<markup>` close-tag** | ~50+ (16 files; promote-each 25) | non-self-closing markup as a value under-reaches; lexer reads `</li>`'s `/` as runaway regex-to-EOF | `lex-in-code.js` `/`-branch (+ translate-stmt sliceSource) | clean-single | S | **LANDED `649f4ef8`** |
| F2 SQL `?{}` in server-fn | ~27 (server-fn-star-sql 11 + sql-loop-hoist 9 + inline-sql 9) | native DROPS `?{...}` SQL body in server fn → 0 `_scrml_sql` → E-PA-002 | `parse-sql-body.js` | single-ish (MULTI-CONTEXT risk: top-level/generator/loop/branch) | M | **IN FLIGHT** (survey-STOP gate) |
| table-for struct-field-drop | ~21 (unit 11 + integ 10) | silent MISCOMPILE: `<tableFor>` emits only the FIRST struct `<th>` (drops rest); compiles clean, html DIFFERS | native struct-field/`<tableFor>` capture (first-field-only — same shape as mario PowerUp enum-body) | single-ish | M | NEXT after F2 |
| lifecycle-shape1 annotation | ~12 | native mis-parses `(.Draft to .Published)` bare-dot lifecycle annotation in typed decl → no tracker → no E-TYPE-001 enforcement (DEFAULT fires, native clean = missing-enforcement) | native typed-decl lifecycle-annotation parse | single | M | lower-leverage (missing-enforce; no emit move) |
| structural-in-logic-body (F7) | ~11 | DEFAULT fires E-STRUCTURAL-ELEMENT-MISPLACED / native clean: native body-parser accepts `<schema>`/`<engine>` inside `${...}` | `tag-frame.js`/body-parser gate | single | S/M | lower-leverage (missing-enforce) |
| engine-body-render | ~11 | silent MISCOMPILE: engine arm text body `<Loading>loading</>` emits `return ""` not `return "loading"` (drops bare-text arm-body) | engine arm-body render text capture | single-ish | M | candidate |
| enum-subset struct-constructor | ~22 (b4 12 + b2 10) | native can't parse `TypeName { field: val }` struct-constructor in expr position → E-EXPR-UNEXPECTED/E-STMT-MISSING-SEMICOLON | `parse-expr.js` primary/atom (no `Ident { … }` recognition) | **multi-ish** (parser + downstream type-res) | M/L | **AVOID single dispatch** (multi-stage) |
| r24-bug-31 if-as-expr/failable | ~12 | **MULTI-GAP**: (a) `<state>…</state>` block → E-MARKUP-002 close-mismatch; (b) `!{}` failable drops `::Variant` arms → E-TYPE-080 | `parse-stmt.js` (`<state>` block) + `!{}` arm parse | **multi-gap (2 roots)** | L | **AVOID** (decompose first) |
| compiler-api per-stage | ~14 | derivative — aggregates other family roots ("compiles without errors") | — | n/a | — | clears as upstream closes; don't dispatch |

## NOT native-parser gaps / flag-to-avoid-misdispatch
- **F8 stdlib `await import()` (13)** — RULED a stdlib-migration task (native stays strict no-`await` enforcer). NOT a parser change.
- **lifecycle-shape1 / structural-in-logic (F7)** — genuine native gaps but **missing-enforcement / inverse-shape** (default fires, native compiles clean); real parity work but lower-leverage (no adopter-corpus emit move). Schedule AFTER emit-producing families.
- **compiler-api** — derivative; clears as upstream parse gaps close.

## Recommended autonomous-loop order (emit-producing, clean-single first)
1. lift close-tag (DONE `649f4ef8`)
2. F2 SQL `?{}`-in-server-fn (IN FLIGHT) — survey-STOP if multi-context
3. table-for struct-field-drop (silent miscompile; single-ish)
4. engine-body-render (silent miscompile; single-ish)
5. → re-measure + re-triage
6. (later) lifecycle / structural-in-logic missing-enforcement
7. (decompose-first) enum-subset struct-ctor; r24-bug-31 multi-gap

## Provenance (fixtures verified default-clean/native-fail, S164)
`/tmp/tri/*` (triage agent) + PA-reproduced: lift `v1.scrml` self-closing PASS / `v2.scrml` close-tag FAIL; F2 `f2b.scrml` (default 2 `_scrml_sql` / native 0 + E-PA-002). Each confirmed default exit 0; native failure/miscompile reproduced. Broken legacy samples (api-dashboard/expense-tracker — fail on default too) were excluded.
