In April we published [**scrml's Living Compiler**](https://dev.to/bryan_maclee/scrmls-living-compiler-23f9).
This is a retraction of its central idea. Not a clarification — a retraction. scrml is
not building the thing that article described, and we want that on the record next to
the original rather than quietly edited out of it.

## What the article proposed

The Living Compiler article opened by calling its subject *"the design choice that
scares me the most."* The idea: the compiler is not frozen — it **evolves with the
ecosystem**. A *transformation registry* would distribute compile-time codegen patterns;
community-authored alternatives would *"graduate to canonical"* once they cleared a
quality gate. And the gate was population-driven:

> "The compiler observes which alternatives are getting used. Population-level signals —
> adoption, regression rate, performance deltas, error counts — feed a quality gate."

Three run modes were proposed — `living` (default), `--stable` (pinned), `--secure`
(vendored-only) — and the article was explicit that *"the default is the bold one."*

It was always future work; nothing shipped. So this retracts a **stated direction**, not
a behaviour. But the direction was the headline, and it was wrong.

## Why we're retracting it

**1. It is incompatible with determinism.** A compiler whose codegen graduates by
population metrics is not a pure function of your source. Two developers with the same
source, on the same compiler version, could get different output depending on what the
ecosystem happened to adopt that month. That is not a compiler — it is a moving target
wearing a compiler's name. Everything scrml has since committed to depends on the
opposite property: compilation as a pure, reproducible function of the source and an
explicit, pinned environment.

**2. It is a supply-chain attack surface.** "The compiler observes which alternatives are
getting used" is telemetry, and metric-graduation is a poisoning vector: game the
adoption signal, graduate a hostile transformation to canonical, and it lands in
everyone's compiler. The article's safeguards — a build-time sandbox, a regression suite
before graduation — are necessary but not sufficient: they verify the *output* is
well-formed, not that the *transformation* is honest. After xz-utils, "the majority
adopted it" is not a trust signal. It is the thing attackers manufacture.

**3. It contradicts what scrml decided to be.** scrml is now a *sealed, bounded*
language: a small, fixed surface, with exactly one explicit, manifest-gated bridge to
host code and nothing ambient. An open registry of community-authored codegen is the
definition of un-sealed. The two cannot both be true, and we chose sealed.

The article was uneasy about its own proposal in print — *"the design choice that scares
me the most,"* *"you're allowed to be suspicious."* That unease was correct. The project
followed it to its conclusion, and the conclusion was: don't.

## What replaces it

The compiler still has a story — it is just a different one. Compilation is a pure
function of two inputs: your source, and an explicit, committed **build story** that
pins the compiler, the language tools, the standard library, and any vendored code, each
by the hash of its content. Anyone with your build story reconstructs your exact
environment and compiles your code identically. The compiler-proper still evolves — but
through governed, human-reviewed adoption, not adoption metrics; no telemetry, no
graduation pipeline, no "collective opinion" in your build. Customization is real, and
it is authoring-time and pinned — never ecosystem-emergent.

We will be honest about the gap: the build story is the direction we have committed to,
not a finished mechanism. One thing it still has to close is that compiler identity is
not yet folded into the content hash. The distinction that matters: the Living Compiler
made determinism **impossible by design**; the build story makes it **achievable, and we
are still hardening it.** Those are not the same kind of incomplete.

## Why publish a retraction instead of an edit

Because eight other published articles link to "scrml's Living Compiler" as a load-bearing
idea, and the honest move is to correct it in public, not to rewrite history. The
original post will carry a banner pointing here; it stays up, wrong, with the wrongness
labelled. A language that is honest about what it is *not* is worth more than one that
silently edits its past.

The original article closed with *"It's alive. Now we have to keep it that way."*

We were wrong about the goal. The compiler is not alive. It is a value — pinned,
content-addressed, inspectable, reproducible. That is better than alive.
